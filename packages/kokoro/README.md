# Kokoro TTS

Kokoro is a frontier TTS model for its size of 82 million parameters (text in/audio out). This JavaScript library allows the model to be run 100% locally in the browser thanks to [ðŸ¤— Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).

This sub-package is a fork of [kokoro-js](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro-js).
